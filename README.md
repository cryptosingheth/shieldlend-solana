# ShieldLend — Privacy-First Lending Protocol on Solana

A zero-knowledge, privacy-preserving lending protocol on Solana. Deposits are unlinkable to wallets, withdrawal destinations are one-time addresses, repayment settlement can use private payments, oracle data is encrypted against MEV, and the signing infrastructure has no single operator key.

Built for the **Colosseum Frontier Hackathon 2026**.

---

## The Problem

On-chain lending has a fundamental privacy problem — and it is not just about hiding amounts.

Every interaction with a lending protocol creates a permanent, public record that an observer can use to build a profile of a user:

| Observable data | What it reveals |
|---|---|
| Deposit transaction | Depositor's wallet, amount, and timing |
| Loan disbursement | Borrower's wallet, loan size, and collateral |
| Repayment transaction | Confirmation that a wallet is a borrower |
| Withdrawal | Links the depositor's wallet to a withdrawal destination |

This matters for individuals who want financial privacy, for institutions that cannot reveal their treasury positions on-chain, and for anyone whose on-chain credit history should not be public record.

Existing privacy tools address one layer at a time: mixers hide amounts but not identities; stealth addresses hide destinations but not deposits; ZK proofs hide which commitment was spent but not who submitted the transaction. ShieldLend addresses all four layers across the full transaction lifecycle.

---

## Design Philosophy

Privacy in DeFi is not a feature — it is a stack.

ShieldLend applies sequential protections across the transaction lifecycle. Each protection closes a specific gap that no other component addresses:

- **Entry protection** (MagicBlock PER + VRF): Deposits execute inside an Intel TDX enclave. Multiple users' deposits batch before any commitment reaches the Merkle tree — no observer can link a wallet to a specific commitment. VRF generates dummy commitments that are indistinguishable from real ones, permanently expanding the anonymity set for all future ring proofs.

- **Relay protection** (IKA dWallet): Every on-chain operation — deposit, withdrawal, borrow, repay — is submitted by the IKA relay wallet, not the user's wallet. The relay is a 2PC-MPC dWallet: no single key exists. Both the user and the IKA MPC network must participate to authorize any relay operation. All exits (withdrawals and borrow disbursements) route through the same relay → PER batch → stealth path, making their type indistinguishable on-chain.

- **State protection** (Encrypt FHE): Oracle price feeds for health factor computation are submitted as FHE ciphertexts. MEV bots cannot compute liquidation trigger conditions from encrypted mempool data. Aggregate solvency is tracked through encrypted collateral coverage and public/bucketed debt accounting without revealing individual collateral positions.

- **Payment protection** (MagicBlock Private Payments): Repayments settle through a private SPL/WSOL payment path. The LendingPool verifies a receipt bound to `loanId`, `nullifierHash`, and `outstanding_balance`, so collateral can unlock without publishing the repayment transfer graph.

- **Exit protection** (Umbra SDK): Every output — withdrawal destinations and loan disbursements — routes to a one-time Umbra stealth address. Each address is derived via ECDH from the recipient's published meta-address, has zero prior chain history, and is abandoned after use.

## Protocol Selection

Every protocol in ShieldLend's stack was chosen to close a specific privacy gap that no other tool addressed. The design started from privacy requirements and worked backwards to protocols — not the other way around.

The component-to-protocol mapping tables below show this gap → choice relationship for every function in the protocol. For the full decision rationale (alternatives considered, tradeoffs evaluated), see [`docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`](docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md).

## Architecture

### Programs

ShieldLend is three Anchor programs. All SOL stays in one place. The other two programs only keep state.

### Privacy Stack

Each layer closes a specific privacy gap. The gap each layer closes cannot be addressed by any other layer in the stack.

## How Unlinkability Is Achieved

### Deposit

The user's wallet never appears in the ShieldedPool deposit transaction.

1. User generates a commitment client-side: `commitment = Poseidon(secret, nullifier, denomination)`. Secret and nullifier never leave the browser.
2. User sends SOL to the IKA relay address (TX1 — visible, but only shows funding of relay).
3. The IKA relay batches this deposit with others inside a **MagicBlock Private Ephemeral Rollup** (Intel TDX enclave). The batch processes privately.
4. PER commits a batch to ShieldedPool (TX2 — signer is the IKA relay wallet, not the user). TX1 and TX2 are not one-to-one.
5. VRF-randomized dummy commitments are inserted alongside real ones, permanently enlarging the anonymity set for all future ring proofs.

Observer sees TX1: "User funded relay." Observer sees TX2: "Relay deposited batch to pool." No linking between them.

### Withdrawal

No observer can connect the depositor's wallet to the withdrawal destination.

1. User loads their note (secret + nullifier) from the local encrypted vault.
2. `snarkjs` generates a **Groth16 ring proof**: proves ownership of one commitment in a ring of 16, without revealing which one. VRF dummies inserted at deposit time appear in the ring — the effective anonymity set exceeds K=16.
3. User sends proof to the **IKA relay** (off-chain). Relay submits the withdrawal transaction on-chain — relay wallet is the signer, not the user's wallet.
4. `groth16-solana` verifies the proof on-chain (< 200k compute units). SOL released from ShieldedPool to relay.
5. The exit is queued in **MagicBlock PER** alongside other withdrawals and borrow disbursements. PER flushes the batch to respective **Umbra stealth addresses**.
6. User derives the private key for their stealth address via Umbra SDK and imports it into Phantom or Solflare — the stealth address is a standard Solana wallet. SOL can be spent from it directly, just like any other wallet.

**Why no auto-forward to the main wallet:** forwarding from stealth address → main wallet would create an on-chain link between the two, permanently undoing the exit privacy. The Umbra stealth address IS the user's receiving wallet for this operation — it has a full Solana private key, derived once via ECDH. There is no friction beyond importing that key. Users can continue to use the stealth address for any on-chain activity or re-deposit into ShieldLend for continued privacy.

The ring proof hides *which* commitment was spent. Relay routing hides *who* submitted the proof. The stealth address hides *where* the funds went. No auto-forward preserves all three.

### Borrow

The collateral identity, borrower wallet, and disbursement destination are not linkable.

1. User selects a committed note as collateral.
2. `snarkjs` generates a **Groth16 collateral proof**: proves ring membership + denomination ≥ borrowed × LTV floor — in-circuit. Ring includes VRF dummies from deposit time.
3. User sends proof to the **IKA relay**. Relay submits on-chain — relay wallet is the signer.
4. `groth16-solana` verifies the proof on-chain.
5. The **IKA dWallet** receives an `approve_message()` CPI. The program validates LTV; the IKA MPC network co-signs the disbursement. Both gates required — no single operator can disburse.
6. SOL exits ShieldedPool → relay → **MagicBlock PER exit batch** (mixed with withdrawals) → **Umbra stealth address**. The exit is indistinguishable from a withdrawal on-chain.

No observer links "this commitment is locked as collateral" to "this wallet received a loan."

### Repay

Repayment does not reveal the borrower's identity. In Full Privacy mode, repayment settlement also avoids publishing a normal repayment transfer graph.

1. User generates a **repay_ring proof**: proves knowledge of the collateral nullifier and binds the repayment to `loanId` and the current `outstanding_balance`. The borrower's wallet is never revealed.
2. User settles repayment through **MagicBlock Private Payments** using private WSOL/SPL payment semantics. The private payment receipt is bound to `loanId`, `nullifierHash`, `outstanding_balance`, and `repayment_vault`.
3. The **IKA relay** submits the repay instruction on-chain — relay wallet is the signer, not the borrower.
4. `groth16-solana` verifies the repay proof, and LendingPool verifies the private payment receipt binding.
5. Loan PDA cleared, nullifier unlocked. Collateral note is ready for withdrawal.

If private payments are unavailable, the protocol can fall back to identity-private repayment through the IKA relay, but repayment amount privacy must not be claimed in that degraded path.

## Flow Diagrams

The canonical diagrams live in [`docs/VISUAL_FLOWS.md`](docs/VISUAL_FLOWS.md). That file contains the protocol role map plus the deposit, withdrawal, borrow, private repayment, liquidation, history/disclosure, and observer-view flows.

The README keeps the narrative and privacy-status table only. This avoids maintaining two separate copies of the same flow charts.

## Funds and Accounting

SOL flows:
- **Deposit**: IKA relay → ShieldedPool (via PER batch)
- **Withdraw**: ShieldedPool → IKA relay → PER exit batch → Umbra stealth address
- **Borrow**: ShieldedPool → IKA relay → PER exit batch → Umbra stealth address (same path as withdraw)
- **Repay**: MagicBlock Private Payments → repayment vault/private balance; IKA relay submits proof + receipt; LendingPool clears loan PDA

---

## ZK Circuits

All circuits produce Groth16 proofs verified on-chain by `groth16-solana`.

| Circuit | Status | Proves | Public inputs/outputs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `withdraw_ring.circom` | Done (update required)* | Ring membership (K=16) + Merkle inclusion at `leaf_index` (depth 24) | `ring[16]`, `nullifierHash`, `root`, `denomination_out` |
| `collateral_ring.circom` | Done (update required)* | Ring membership + `denomination × minRatioBps ≥ borrowed × 10000` | `ring[16]`, `nullifierHash`, `root`, `borrowed`, `minRatioBps` |
| `repay_ring.circom` | **TODO** | Nullifier knowledge + binding to private payment receipt and `outstanding_balance` | `nullifierHash`, `loanId`, `outstanding_balance`, `settlementReceiptHash` |

*`withdraw_ring` and `collateral_ring` require a nullifier formula update (add `leaf_index` private input) before they can be recompiled. The compiled `.wasm` files in `frontend/public/circuits/` are currently stale and must not be used until the circuits are updated and recompiled.

**Nullifier formula** (all circuits): `nullifierHash = Poseidon(nullifier, leaf_index, SHIELDED_POOL_PROGRAM_ID)`

- `leaf_index`: private input proving position in the Merkle tree — prevents re-insertion attacks
- `SHIELDED_POOL_PROGRAM_ID`: domain separator — prevents cross-contract nullifier correlation

**Root validation**: proofs are valid against any of the 30 most recent Merkle roots (not just the current root). Users can be offline for approximately 2.5 hours (30 epochs × ~5 minutes per epoch) without losing access to their notes.

---

## Fixed Denominations

Deposits use fixed denominations (0.1 SOL, 1 SOL, 10 SOL). This is a requirement of the ZK circuit design: denomination is embedded in the commitment hash and is a public output of the withdrawal proof. Standardized denominations prevent amount-based correlation — every participant in a denomination pool looks identical on-chain.

| Denomination | Lamports |
|---|---|
| 0.1 SOL | 100,000,000 |
| 1 SOL | 1,000,000,000 |
| 10 SOL | 10,000,000,000 |

Loan amounts are public or bucketed. The borrow amount appears as a public input to the collateral ring circuit because the protocol must deterministically verify LTV, interest accrual, reserve accounting, and liquidation thresholds on-chain. This is amount metadata leakage, not identity linkage: the borrower wallet, collateral note, and disbursement destination remain unlinked when the relay, ring proof, PER exit batch, and Umbra path are used correctly.

---

## Protocol Solvency — Aggregate Without Individual Exposure

ShieldLend maintains continuous solvency guarantees without revealing oracle price data or individual collateral positions.

**Aggregate monitoring (always-on):** Oracle price feeds are submitted as Encrypt FHE ciphertexts. Collateral values are computed homomorphically — price × denomination for each active loan — and summed without decrypting any individual position:
```
total_collateral_value = Σ(FHE_price × denomination[i])   // FHE multiplication + addition
total_outstanding      = Σ(borrow_amount[i])               // plaintext sum — borrow amounts are public
```
Threshold decryption reveals ONLY `total_collateral_value`. Individual collateral positions and the oracle price used for computation stay hidden. MEV bots monitoring the mempool cannot compute breach conditions from encrypted price inputs.

**Targeted audit (on-demand):** For compliance disclosure of a specific loan, the user can export selected local history records, proof public signals, transaction signatures, receipt hashes, and optional Encrypt threshold evidence for collateral/health. Borrower identity is not revealed unless the user chooses to disclose it.

## Component → Protocol Mapping

### ShieldedPool

| Function | Protocol | Why this protocol |
|---|---|---|
| Deposit batching + execution | MagicBlock PER (TDX enclave) | Intel TDX required to batch deposits without any party observing the deposit→commitment mapping |
| Exit batching (withdrawals + disbursements) | MagicBlock PER (same enclave) | Both withdrawal and borrow disbursement exits batch together — type indistinguishable on-chain |
| Anonymity set expansion | MagicBlock VRF | Dummy insertions must be cryptographically unbiasable; VRF provides per-shuffle on-chain verifiable randomness; carries forward into all future ring proofs |
| Withdrawal submission | IKA relay | User wallet would be the ring proof transaction signer if submitted directly — permanently linking wallet to 16 ring candidates; relay routing prevents this |
| Withdrawal authorization | groth16-solana | Ring proof verified on-chain atomically with fund release; BN254 native syscalls (<200k CU) |
| Withdrawal recipient | Umbra SDK | One-time stealth address with zero prior history; Umbra SDK handles generation, key derivation |

### LendingPool

| Function | Protocol | Why this protocol |
|---|---|---|
| Interest rate model | Kamino klend fork | Poly-linear 11-point model from a $3.2B TVL production protocol; audited; Anchor-native |
| Collateral proof verification | groth16-solana | LTV check is a circuit constraint — must verify on-chain before disbursement |
| Private repayment settlement | MagicBlock Private Payments | Repayment value can settle privately while LendingPool receives a receipt bound to the loan, vault, and outstanding balance |
| Repayment proof verification | groth16-solana | Repay proof hides borrower identity and binds the collateral nullifier to a valid private payment receipt before clearing the LoanAccount |
| Disbursement routing | IKA relay + PER | Disbursement exits same relay → PER → stealth path as withdrawals; indistinguishable on-chain |
| Disbursement signing | IKA dWallet | Co-signing requires program LTV validation AND IKA MPC network; no single operator key |
| Disbursement recipient | Umbra SDK | Same reason as withdrawals — fresh stealth address, borrower wallet never on-chain |
| Oracle MEV prevention | Encrypt FHE | Price feeds as FHE ciphertexts; health_factor computed homomorphically; MEV bots cannot read pending price updates |
| Aggregate solvency | Encrypt FHE | Homomorphic sum of encrypted collateral values; only aggregate coverage is revealed |
| Compliance disclosure | Encrypt threshold decryption | Individual loan balance disclosed to auditor via 2/3 MPC threshold decrypt; no global exposure |
| Liquidation pre-authorization | IKA FutureSign | Borrower consents at borrow time; neither borrower (cannot block) nor operator (cannot trigger without condition) has unilateral control |

---

## Operational Modes

ShieldLend has three operational modes that degrade gracefully when external dependencies are unavailable. Full documentation is in [`docs/NOTE_LIFECYCLE.md`](docs/NOTE_LIFECYCLE.md).

| Mode | Activates when | Privacy level |
|---|---|---|
| **Full Privacy** (default) | All dependencies operational | Maximum — relay, ZK, PER, private payments, FHE, and Umbra active |
| **Degraded Privacy** | MagicBlock PER offline for `per_fallback_epoch_threshold` epochs | Reduced — temporal unlinking lost; ZK ring + Umbra stealth still active |
| **Emergency** | PER and IKA both offline (governance vote required) | Minimal — user wallet appears on-chain as signer; fund recovery prioritized |

**Full Privacy**: Deposit path runs through IKA relay → MagicBlock PER enclave → ShieldedPool batch. Borrow and withdrawal exits route through PER → Umbra stealth. Repayments settle through MagicBlock Private Payments with receipt binding. All privacy layers are active.

**Degraded Privacy**: PER or private payment support is bypassed. Deposits and exits go directly relay → ShieldedPool without batching, or repayment uses a normal relay transfer. Timing correlation and repayment amount leakage become possible. ZK ring proofs (which commitment was spent), relay signer privacy, and Umbra stealth addresses (where funds go) remain active. Frontend displays a prominent banner when this mode is active.

**Emergency**: Both PER and IKA are unavailable. `emergency_withdraw(ring_proof)` releases SOL directly to the user's own wallet — no relay, no stealth address. The user's wallet appears on-chain as the transaction signer. This mode exists solely to guarantee fund recovery; it is a last resort and requires a multi-sig governance vote with time-lock to activate.

## Pre-Alpha Status

Several protocols used in ShieldLend are in pre-alpha or gated devnet. Hackathon implementation targets real protocol adapters first. If a dependency is unavailable, fallback adapters must be clearly labeled and the UI/docs must reduce the relevant privacy claim for that mode. Production deployments require mainnet availability.

| Protocol | Devnet status | Hackathon approach | Production path |
|---|---|---|---|
| IKA dWallet | Pre-alpha / gated devnet | Real adapter first; fallback signer only if unavailable and explicitly labeled | IKA Solana mainnet |
| Encrypt FHE | Pre-alpha / gated devnet | Real adapter first; fallback health/oracle adapter only if unavailable and explicitly labeled | Encrypt mainnet |
| MagicBlock PER + Private Payments | Devnet (Discord access required) | Real PER, VRF, and private repayment integration where available | MagicBlock PER/private payments mainnet |
| groth16-solana | Mainnet-beta ready | Full production integration | BN254 syscalls live since Solana 1.18.x |
| Umbra SDK | Mainnet alpha (Solana, Feb 2026) | Full production integration | Production-ready |

## Hackathon Tracks

| Track | Sponsor | ShieldLend implements |
|---|---|---|
| IKA + Encrypt Frontier | Superteam | dWallet relay authorization, FutureSign liquidation consent, encrypted oracle/health computation, aggregate solvency |
| Colosseum Privacy Track | MagicBlock | PER deposit batching, PER exit batching, VRF dummy insertion, private repayment settlement |
| Umbra Side Track | Frontier | Umbra SDK for output stealth addresses, exit hygiene, and optional disclosure patterns |

Each track covers a distinct privacy layer — entry execution, transaction authorization, private repayment settlement, encrypted state, and exit address hygiene — with no overlap between them. For full track-by-track integration details and non-overlap justification, see [`docs/HACKATHON.md`](docs/HACKATHON.md).

## Architecture Inspirations

ShieldLend builds on proven patterns from production privacy protocols — historical root ring buffers (Railgun, Tornado Cash), position-dependent nullifiers (Penumbra), app-siloed nullifier domains (Aztec), and three-step async liquidation adapted from Laolex/shieldlend's EVM implementation. Two patterns are original to this design: VRF dummy indistinguishability and the unified exit path that makes withdrawal and borrow disbursement structurally identical on-chain.
