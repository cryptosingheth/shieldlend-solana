# ShieldLend — Privacy-First Lending Protocol on Solana

A zero-knowledge, privacy-preserving lending protocol on Solana. Deposits are unlinkable to wallets, withdrawal destinations are one-time addresses, oracle data is encrypted against MEV, and the signing infrastructure has no single operator key.

Built for the **Colosseum Frontier Hackathon 2026**.

---

## The Problem

On-chain lending has a fundamental privacy problem — and it is not just about hiding amounts.

Every interaction with a lending protocol creates a permanent, public record that an observer can use to build a profile of a user:

| Observable data | What it reveals |
|---|---|
| Deposit transaction | Depositor's wallet, amount, and timing |
| Loan disbursement | Borrower's wallet, loan size, and collateral |
| Repayment transaction | Confirmation that a wallet is a borrower |
| Withdrawal | Links the depositor's wallet to a withdrawal destination |

This matters for individuals who want financial privacy, for institutions that cannot reveal their treasury positions on-chain, and for anyone whose on-chain credit history should not be public record.

Existing privacy tools address one layer at a time: mixers hide amounts but not identities; stealth addresses hide destinations but not deposits; ZK proofs hide which commitment was spent but not who submitted the transaction. ShieldLend addresses all four layers across the full transaction lifecycle.

---

## Design Philosophy

Privacy in DeFi is not a feature — it is a stack.

ShieldLend applies four sequential protections across the transaction lifecycle. Each protection closes a specific gap that no other component addresses:

- **Entry protection** (MagicBlock PER + VRF): Deposits execute inside an Intel TDX enclave. Multiple users' deposits batch before any commitment reaches the Merkle tree — no observer can link a wallet to a specific commitment. VRF generates dummy commitments that are indistinguishable from real ones, permanently expanding the anonymity set for all future ring proofs.

- **Relay protection** (IKA dWallet): Every on-chain operation — deposit, withdrawal, borrow, repay — is submitted by the IKA relay wallet, not the user's wallet. The relay is a 2PC-MPC dWallet: no single key exists. Both the user and the IKA MPC network must participate to authorize any relay operation. All exits (withdrawals and borrow disbursements) route through the same relay → PER batch → stealth path, making their type indistinguishable on-chain.

- **State protection** (Encrypt FHE): Oracle price feeds for health factor computation are submitted as FHE ciphertexts. MEV bots cannot compute liquidation trigger conditions from encrypted mempool data. Aggregate solvency is tracked via homomorphic sum — total outstanding debt is verifiable without revealing individual positions.

- **Exit protection** (Umbra SDK): Every output — withdrawal destinations and loan disbursements — routes to a one-time Umbra stealth address. Each address is derived via ECDH from the recipient's published meta-address, has zero prior chain history, and is abandoned after use.

## Protocol Selection

Every protocol in ShieldLend's stack was chosen to close a specific privacy gap that no other tool addressed. The design started from privacy requirements and worked backwards to protocols — not the other way around.

The component-to-protocol mapping tables below show this gap → choice relationship for every function in the protocol. For the full decision rationale (alternatives considered, tradeoffs evaluated), see [`docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`](docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md).

## Architecture

### Programs

ShieldLend is three Anchor programs. All SOL stays in one place. The other two programs only keep state.

### Privacy Stack

Each layer closes a specific privacy gap. The gap each layer closes cannot be addressed by any other layer in the stack.

## How Unlinkability Is Achieved

### Deposit

The user's wallet never appears in the ShieldedPool deposit transaction.

1. User generates a commitment client-side: `commitment = Poseidon(secret, nullifier, denomination)`. Secret and nullifier never leave the browser.
2. User sends SOL to the IKA relay address (TX1 — visible, but only shows funding of relay).
3. The IKA relay batches this deposit with others inside a **MagicBlock Private Ephemeral Rollup** (Intel TDX enclave). The batch processes privately.
4. PER commits a batch to ShieldedPool (TX2 — signer is the IKA relay wallet, not the user). TX1 and TX2 are not one-to-one.
5. VRF-randomized dummy commitments are inserted alongside real ones, permanently enlarging the anonymity set for all future ring proofs.

Observer sees TX1: "User funded relay." Observer sees TX2: "Relay deposited batch to pool." No linking between them.

### Withdrawal

No observer can connect the depositor's wallet to the withdrawal destination.

1. User loads their note (secret + nullifier) from the local encrypted vault.
2. `snarkjs` generates a **Groth16 ring proof**: proves ownership of one commitment in a ring of 16, without revealing which one. VRF dummies inserted at deposit time appear in the ring — the effective anonymity set exceeds K=16.
3. User sends proof to the **IKA relay** (off-chain). Relay submits the withdrawal transaction on-chain — relay wallet is the signer, not the user's wallet.
4. `groth16-solana` verifies the proof on-chain (< 200k compute units). SOL released from ShieldedPool to relay.
5. The exit is queued in **MagicBlock PER** alongside other withdrawals and borrow disbursements. PER flushes the batch to respective **Umbra stealth addresses**.
6. User derives the private key for their stealth address via Umbra SDK and imports it into Phantom or Solflare — the stealth address is a standard Solana wallet. SOL can be spent from it directly, just like any other wallet.

**Why no auto-forward to the main wallet:** forwarding from stealth address → main wallet would create an on-chain link between the two, permanently undoing the exit privacy. The Umbra stealth address IS the user's receiving wallet for this operation — it has a full Solana private key, derived once via ECDH. There is no friction beyond importing that key. Users can continue to use the stealth address for any on-chain activity or re-deposit into ShieldLend for continued privacy.

The ring proof hides *which* commitment was spent. Relay routing hides *who* submitted the proof. The stealth address hides *where* the funds went. No auto-forward preserves all three.

### Borrow

The collateral identity, borrower wallet, and disbursement destination are not linkable.

1. User selects a committed note as collateral.
2. `snarkjs` generates a **Groth16 collateral proof**: proves ring membership + denomination ≥ borrowed × LTV floor — in-circuit. Ring includes VRF dummies from deposit time.
3. User sends proof to the **IKA relay**. Relay submits on-chain — relay wallet is the signer.
4. `groth16-solana` verifies the proof on-chain.
5. The **IKA dWallet** receives an `approve_message()` CPI. The program validates LTV; the IKA MPC network co-signs the disbursement. Both gates required — no single operator can disburse.
6. SOL exits ShieldedPool → relay → **MagicBlock PER exit batch** (mixed with withdrawals) → **Umbra stealth address**. The exit is indistinguishable from a withdrawal on-chain.

No observer links "this commitment is locked as collateral" to "this wallet received a loan."

### Repay

Repayment does not reveal the borrower's identity or the repayment amount.

1. User generates a **repay_ring proof**: proves knowledge of the collateral nullifier. The repayment amount satisfies `repaymentAmount ≥ outstanding_balance` — verified in-circuit with repaymentAmount as a private input. The borrower's wallet is never revealed.
2. SOL goes via the **IKA relay** — indistinguishable from deposit relay traffic.
3. `groth16-solana` verifies the repay proof on-chain.
4. Loan PDA cleared, nullifier unlocked. Collateral note is ready for withdrawal.

## Funds and Accounting

SOL flows:
- **Deposit**: IKA relay → ShieldedPool (via PER batch)
- **Withdraw**: ShieldedPool → IKA relay → PER exit batch → Umbra stealth address
- **Borrow**: ShieldedPool → IKA relay → PER exit batch → Umbra stealth address (same path as withdraw)
- **Repay**: IKA relay → ShieldedPool; LendingPool clears loan PDA

---

## ZK Circuits

All circuits produce Groth16 proofs verified on-chain by `groth16-solana`.

| Circuit | Status | Proves | Public inputs/outputs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `withdraw_ring.circom` | Done (update required)* | Ring membership (K=16) + Merkle inclusion at `leaf_index` (depth 24) | `ring[16]`, `nullifierHash`, `root`, `denomination_out` |
| `collateral_ring.circom` | Done (update required)* | Ring membership + `denomination × minRatioBps ≥ borrowed × 10000` | `ring[16]`, `nullifierHash`, `root`, `borrowed`, `minRatioBps` |
| `repay_ring.circom` | **TODO** | Nullifier knowledge + `repaymentAmount ≥ outstanding_balance` (in-circuit, amount private) | `nullifierHash`, `loanId`, `outstanding_balance` |

*`withdraw_ring` and `collateral_ring` require a nullifier formula update (add `leaf_index` private input) before they can be recompiled. The compiled `.wasm` files in `frontend/public/circuits/` are currently stale and must not be used until the circuits are updated and recompiled.

**Nullifier formula** (all circuits): `nullifierHash = Poseidon(nullifier, leaf_index, SHIELDED_POOL_PROGRAM_ID)`

- `leaf_index`: private input proving position in the Merkle tree — prevents re-insertion attacks
- `SHIELDED_POOL_PROGRAM_ID`: domain separator — prevents cross-contract nullifier correlation

**Root validation**: proofs are valid against any of the 30 most recent Merkle roots (not just the current root). Users can be offline for approximately 2.5 hours (30 epochs × ~5 minutes per epoch) without losing access to their notes.

---

## Fixed Denominations

Deposits use fixed denominations (0.1 SOL, 1 SOL, 10 SOL). This is a requirement of the ZK circuit design: denomination is embedded in the commitment hash and is a public output of the withdrawal proof. Standardized denominations prevent amount-based correlation — every participant in a denomination pool looks identical on-chain.

| Denomination | Lamports |
|---|---|
| 0.1 SOL | 100,000,000 |
| 1 SOL | 1,000,000,000 |
| 10 SOL | 10,000,000,000 |

Loan amounts are variable. The borrow amount appears as a public input to the collateral ring circuit — required for on-chain LTV verification binding.

---

## Protocol Solvency — Aggregate Without Individual Exposure

ShieldLend maintains continuous solvency guarantees without revealing oracle price data or individual collateral positions.

**Aggregate monitoring (always-on):** Oracle price feeds are submitted as Encrypt FHE ciphertexts. Collateral values are computed homomorphically — price × denomination for each active loan — and summed without decrypting any individual position:
```
total_collateral_value = Σ(FHE_price × denomination[i])   // FHE multiplication + addition
total_outstanding      = Σ(borrow_amount[i])               // plaintext sum — borrow amounts are public
```
Threshold decryption reveals ONLY `total_collateral_value`. Individual collateral positions and the oracle price used for computation stay hidden. MEV bots monitoring the mempool cannot compute breach conditions from encrypted price inputs.

**Targeted audit (on-demand):** For compliance disclosure of a specific loan, threshold decryption reveals that loan's outstanding balance to the auditor. Borrower identity is not revealed — only the amount.

## Component → Protocol Mapping

### ShieldedPool

| Function | Protocol | Why this protocol |
|---|---|---|
| Deposit batching + execution | MagicBlock PER (TDX enclave) | Intel TDX required to batch deposits without any party observing the deposit→commitment mapping |
| Exit batching (withdrawals + disbursements) | MagicBlock PER (same enclave) | Both withdrawal and borrow disbursement exits batch together — type indistinguishable on-chain |
| Anonymity set expansion | MagicBlock VRF | Dummy insertions must be cryptographically unbiasable; VRF provides per-shuffle on-chain verifiable randomness; carries forward into all future ring proofs |
| Withdrawal submission | IKA relay | User wallet would be the ring proof transaction signer if submitted directly — permanently linking wallet to 16 ring candidates; relay routing prevents this |
| Withdrawal authorization | groth16-solana | Ring proof verified on-chain atomically with fund release; BN254 native syscalls (<200k CU) |
| Withdrawal recipient | Umbra SDK | One-time stealth address with zero prior history; Umbra SDK handles generation, key derivation |

### LendingPool

| Function | Protocol | Why this protocol |
|---|---|---|
| Interest rate model | Kamino klend fork | Poly-linear 11-point model from a $3.2B TVL production protocol; audited; Anchor-native |
| Collateral proof verification | groth16-solana | LTV check is a circuit constraint — must verify on-chain before disbursement |
| Repayment proof verification | groth16-solana | Repay proof hides repayment amount (private input) and borrower wallet; on-chain verification required to clear loan PDA |
| Disbursement routing | IKA relay + PER | Disbursement exits same relay → PER → stealth path as withdrawals; indistinguishable on-chain |
| Disbursement signing | IKA dWallet | Co-signing requires program LTV validation AND IKA MPC network; no single operator key |
| Disbursement recipient | Umbra SDK | Same reason as withdrawals — fresh stealth address, borrower wallet never on-chain |
| Oracle MEV prevention | Encrypt FHE | Price feeds as FHE ciphertexts; health_factor computed homomorphically; MEV bots cannot read pending price updates |
| Aggregate solvency | Encrypt FHE | Homomorphic sum of loan balances; only total revealed, individual positions stay encrypted |
| Compliance disclosure | Encrypt threshold decryption | Individual loan balance disclosed to auditor via 2/3 MPC threshold decrypt; no global exposure |
| Liquidation pre-authorization | IKA FutureSign | Borrower consents at borrow time; neither borrower (cannot block) nor operator (cannot trigger without condition) has unilateral control |

## Operational Modes

ShieldLend has three operational modes that degrade gracefully when external dependencies are unavailable. Full documentation is in [`docs/NOTE_LIFECYCLE.md`](docs/NOTE_LIFECYCLE.md).

| Mode | Activates when | Privacy level |
|---|---|---|
| **Full Privacy** (default) | All dependencies operational | Maximum — all four layers active |
| **Degraded Privacy** | MagicBlock PER offline for `per_fallback_epoch_threshold` epochs | Reduced — temporal unlinking lost; ZK ring + Umbra stealth still active |
| **Emergency** | PER and IKA both offline (governance vote required) | Minimal — user wallet appears on-chain as signer; fund recovery prioritized |

**Full Privacy**: Deposit path runs through IKA relay → MagicBlock PER enclave → ShieldedPool batch. Exit path routes through PER → Umbra stealth. All four privacy layers active.

**Degraded Privacy**: PER is bypassed. Deposits and exits go directly relay → ShieldedPool without batching. Timing correlation between deposit and exit becomes possible. ZK ring proofs (which commitment was spent) and Umbra stealth addresses (where funds go) remain fully active. Frontend displays a prominent banner when this mode is active.

**Emergency**: Both PER and IKA are unavailable. `emergency_withdraw(ring_proof)` releases SOL directly to the user's own wallet — no relay, no stealth address. The user's wallet appears on-chain as the transaction signer. This mode exists solely to guarantee fund recovery; it is a last resort and requires a multi-sig governance vote with time-lock to activate.

## Tech Stack

**On-Chain**
- Anchor (Rust smart contracts)
- Kamino klend fork (lending logic)
- groth16-solana (ZK proof verification, BN254 native syscalls, Light Protocol Labs)
- MagicBlock PER macros — `#[ephemeral]`, `#[delegate]`, `#[commit]` (planned)
- MagicBlock VRF SDK (planned)
- IKA dWallet Anchor CPI — `ika-dwallet-anchor` (planned — mock signer for hackathon)
- Encrypt FHE Anchor integration — `encrypt-anchor` (planned — plaintext fallback for hackathon)
- Poseidon hash (matching circuits)

**Off-Chain / Client**
- snarkjs 0.7.4 (Groth16 browser proof generation, ~1.2s)
- Circom (withdraw_ring, collateral_ring, repay_ring)
- Umbra SDK (TypeScript, stealthaddress.dev)
- AES-256-GCM + HKDF (client-side note vault, from wallet signature)
- Next.js 14 + React 18
- @solana/wallet-adapter + @solana/web3.js (`onAccountChange` for post-flush automation)

## Pre-Alpha Status

Several protocols used in ShieldLend are in pre-alpha on devnet. Hackathon integration uses mock signers / unencrypted fallbacks. Production deployments require mainnet availability.

| Protocol | Devnet status | Hackathon approach | Production path |
|---|---|---|---|
| IKA dWallet | Pre-alpha | Mock signer — all integration points, CPI patterns, and method signatures implemented as production | IKA Solana mainnet |
| Encrypt FHE | Pre-alpha | Plaintext fallback with FHE interface stubs | Encrypt mainnet |
| MagicBlock PER | Devnet (Discord access required) | Full devnet integration | MagicBlock PER mainnet |
| groth16-solana | Mainnet-beta ready | Full production integration | BN254 syscalls live since Solana 1.18.x |
| Umbra SDK | Mainnet alpha (Solana, Feb 2026) | Full production integration | Production-ready |

---

## Hackathon Tracks

| Track | Sponsor | ShieldLend implements |
|---|---|---|
| IKA + Encrypt Frontier | Superteam | dWallet relay (all flows) + FutureSign + encrypted oracle + aggregate solvency |
| Colosseum Privacy Track | MagicBlock | PER deposit batching + PER exit batching + VRF dummy insertion |
| Umbra Side Track | Frontier | Umbra SDK for all output addresses (withdrawals + loan disbursements) |

Each track covers a distinct privacy layer — entry execution, transaction routing, on-chain state, and exit address — with no overlap between them. For full track-by-track integration details and non-overlap justification, see [`docs/HACKATHON.md`](docs/HACKATHON.md).

---

## Architecture Inspirations

ShieldLend builds on proven patterns from production privacy protocols — historical root ring buffers (Railgun, Tornado Cash), position-dependent nullifiers (Penumbra), app-siloed nullifier domains (Aztec), and three-step async liquidation adapted from Laolex/shieldlend's EVM implementation. Two patterns are original to this design: VRF dummy indistinguishability and the unified exit path that makes withdrawal and borrow disbursement structurally identical on-chain.
