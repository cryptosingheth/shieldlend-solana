## What Works on Devnet (Confirmed)

### ShieldLend Core (C2H)

All three Anchor programs are deployed on Solana devnet:

| Program | Program ID |
|---|---|
| `nullifier_registry` | `E42nSmqvSCuC1EWbmzYqsdLHimBMeuZyir5dB5gE24rF` |
| `shielded_pool` | `9Bvt3jMawHFRRxpaQTtV5VvFdpZkmAZtvwjTrAX9TAtE` |
| `lending_pool` | `HLtWrvLyc2SE3ERWHaEdY4RG84GxFfHv3Qf4NzJPxaF7` |

Full withdraw round-trip confirmed on devnet:

```
deposit → flush_epoch → store_withdraw_proof → withdraw
```

On-chain Groth16 BN254 verification results:
- Pairing check: passed
- Proof consumed (nullifier registered)
- Nullifier registry CPI: succeeded
- Compute units: 198,502 CU

Trusted setup: DEV/TEST `pot14` ceremony only. Not production.

### Privacy Rail Status

| Rail | What is confirmed | What is not live |
|---|---|---|
| **C2H / Groth16** | Full devnet round-trip: deposit → flush_epoch → store_withdraw_proof → withdraw. On-chain BN254 pairing passed. 198,502 CU. Nullifier consumed. | Production trusted setup. Production privacy guarantee. |
| **Umbra** | `@umbra-privacy/sdk@4.0.0` installed. Funded devnet wSOL encrypted-balance deposit and withdrawal confirmed. Seven transaction signatures on record. | Native SOL ShieldLend payout routed through Umbra. C2H still exits via direct `stealth_address`. wSOL/SPL bridge not implemented. |
| **Encrypt** | Live pre-alpha gRPC `encrypt.v1.EncryptService/CreateInput` probe confirmed. Health-ratio test value submitted. Ciphertext handle returned: `5VZ8BhpSWqDCAXMMb4ESVGsQRKb6X9dDgD1xGLydCA6y`. | On-chain FHE. `encrypt-anchor` CPI integration (blocked by Anchor 0.32.1 requirement). Production encryption guarantee. |
| **MagicBlock** | TEE RPC `https://devnet-tee.magicblock.app` HTTP 200. Router RPC `https://devnet-router.magicblock.app` HTTP 200. PER sidecar TypeScript builders: 4 ShieldLend use-case bundles, 17/17 pass. Private Payments API `https://payments.magicblock.app` health/challenge/login/mint/balance/builders live; wSOL deposit and withdraw signed/submitted on devnet. Private-transfer unsigned tx can be submitted through base devnet only after local blockhash refresh. | Rust PER macros in Anchor programs (blocked: Anchor 0.30.1 vs 0.32.1 required). Intended `sendTo=ephemeral` private-transfer submit is still blocked: router returns `Blockhash not found`, TEE rejects writable accounts. TDX attestation challenge format mismatch with SDK 0.8.8. |
| **IKA** | `@ika.xyz/sdk@0.4.0` + WASM loaded. SDK/capability probe: `createDWallet`, `approveMessage`, `createSignature`, `SignatureScheme` all present. WASM `createClassGroupsKeypair(ED25519)` runs locally. | Real Solana relay signing. `ika-dwallet-anchor` CPI crate not published. IKA SDK has no Solana code — all `coordinatorTransactions` functions call Sui Move targets. Direct wallet fallback is labelled "reduced privacy" in UI. |

## Claim Boundary

These claims are accurate and supported by devnet evidence:

- Three Anchor programs deployed on Solana devnet.
- Full Groth16 BN254 withdraw round-trip confirmed on devnet (DEV/TEST trusted setup).
- On-chain nullifier registry CPI succeeded; proof consumed.
- Umbra `@umbra-privacy/sdk@4.0.0` funded devnet deposit/withdraw confirmed for wSOL.
- Encrypt live pre-alpha gRPC `CreateInput` probe confirmed with returned ciphertext handle.
- MagicBlock TEE RPC + Router RPC HTTP 200 on devnet.
- MagicBlock PER sidecar TypeScript SDK builders verified (not submitted on-chain).
- MagicBlock Private Payments public API health/challenge/login/mint/balance and unsigned transaction builders verified on devnet.
- MagicBlock Private Payments wSOL deposit and withdraw signed locally and submitted on devnet.
- MagicBlock Private Payments private-transfer transaction submitted only through base devnet after local blockhash refresh; this does not confirm the ephemeral/router private-transfer path.
- IKA SDK/capability probe and WASM confirmed.
- Frontend privacy status panel shows live-checked adapter status for all four rails.
- All four rail adapters present in `frontend/src/lib/privacyRails/`.

These claims are NOT accurate and must NOT be made:

- Production ZK trusted setup (DEV/TEST `pot14` ceremony only).
- Production privacy (no production trusted setup means no production ZK privacy guarantee).
- IKA relay signing active (direct wallet fallback only; no `ika-dwallet-anchor` CPI).
- MagicBlock Private Payments private transfer through the intended ephemeral/router path (builder returns 200; router submit still blocks with `Blockhash not found`; TEE rejects writable accounts).
- MagicBlock PER macros in Anchor programs (Anchor version gap: 0.30.1 vs 0.32.1 required).
- MagicBlock TDX attestation verified (challenge format mismatch).
- Umbra native SOL ShieldLend payout (C2H exits native SOL directly; wSOL bridge not wired).
- Encrypt on-chain FHE active (program-side FHE blocked by Anchor 0.32.1 requirement).
- Any full end-to-end privacy rail active from deposit to encrypted exit.

## Implementation Blockers (Honest Findings)

These are engineering blockers discovered during integration, not design failures:

| Blocker | Root cause | Unblock path |
|---|---|---|
| Encrypt on-chain FHE | `encrypt-anchor` requires Anchor 0.32.1; workspace uses 0.30.1 to protect confirmed Groth16 round-trip | Isolated Anchor 0.32 sidecar program; re-run C2H devnet round-trip after upgrade |
| MagicBlock PER Rust macros | Same Anchor version gap | Same isolated upgrade path |
| MagicBlock Private Payments private transfer submit | API returns unsigned `sendTo=ephemeral` transaction. Decoded tx blockhash matches API response, but base/TEE report it invalid and base sees the API last-valid height as expired. Refreshing blockhash still leaves router blocked with `Blockhash not found`; TEE rejects writable accounts. Base devnet accepts the refreshed tx, but that is not the intended ephemeral route. | Confirm the correct ephemeral submit RPC or API blockhash behavior with MagicBlock |
| MagicBlock TDX attestation | SDK 0.8.8 challenge format mismatch with current devnet TEE | Upgrade SDK or match challenge encoding |
| IKA Solana relay signing | `ika-dwallet-anchor` CPI crate not published; IKA SDK calls Sui Move, not Solana | Wait for IKA Solana CPI crate; or implement Sui-side relay adapter |
| Umbra native SOL payout | Umbra SDK supports SPL/Token-2022 only; C2H exits native SOL | Add SOL → wSOL wrap leg in ShieldedPool before Umbra SDK call |
